Fixture Loading
===============

behave-django can load your fixtures for you per feature/scenario. There are
two approaches to this:

* loading the fixtures in ``environment.py``, or
* using a decorator on your step function


Fixtures in environment.py
--------------------------

In ``environment.py`` we can load our context with the fixtures array.

.. code-block:: python

    def before_all(context):
        context.fixtures = ['user-data.json']

This fixture would then be loaded before every scenario.

If you wanted different fixtures for different scenarios:

.. code-block:: python

    def before_scenario(context, scenario):
        if scenario.name == 'User login with valid credentials':
            context.fixtures = ['user-data.json']
        elif scenario.name == 'Check out cart':
            context.fixtures = ['user-data.json', 'store.json', 'cart.json']
        else:
            # Resetting fixtures, otherwise previously set fixtures carry
            # over to subsequent scenarios.
            context.fixtures = []

You could also have fixtures per Feature too

.. code-block:: python

    def before_feature(context, feature):
        if feature.name == 'Login':
            context.fixtures = ['user-data.json']
            # This works because behave will use the same context for
            # everything below Feature. (Scenarios, Outlines, Backgrounds)
        else:
            # Resetting fixtures, otherwise previously set fixtures carry
            # over to subsequent features.
            context.fixtures = []

Of course, since ``context.fixtures`` is really just a list, you can mutate it
however you want, it will only be processed upon leaving the
``before_scenario()`` function of your ``environment.py`` file. Just keep in
mind that it does not reset between features or scenarios, unless explicitly
done so (as shown in the examples above).

.. note::

    If you provide initial data via Python code `using the ORM`_ you need
    to place these calls in ``before_scenario()`` even if the data is
    meant to be used on the whole feature.  This is because Django's
    ``LiveServerTestCase`` resets the test database after each scenario.

Fixtures using a decorator
--------------------------

You can define `Django fixtures`_ using a function decorator. The decorator will
load the fixtures in the ``before_scenario``, as documented above. It is merely
a convenient way to keep fixtures close to your steps.

.. code-block::  python

    from behave_django.decorators import fixtures

    @fixtures('users.json')
    @when('someone does something')
    def step_impl(context):
        pass

.. note::

     Fixtures included with the decorator will apply to all other steps that
     they share a scenario with. This is because behave-django needs to provide
     them to the test environment before processing the particular scenario.

Support for multiple databases
------------------------------

By default Django only loads fixtures into the ``default`` database.

Use ``before_scenario`` to load the fixtures in all of the databases you have
configured, if your tests rely on the fixtures being loaded in all of them.

.. code-block:: python

    def before_scenario(context, scenario):
        context.multi_db = True

You can read more about it in the `Multiple database docs`_.
